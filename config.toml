I have worked remotely for a startup called OptumSoft based in the Silicon Valley for 2 years. On top of my extensive work in distributed systems design, I have elaborated the strategy to add front-end experience to the backend-based product and brought new team members in this project along the way. This move enabled the company to get in a more suitable shape to launch a product to market.

I have now joined 28msec where I am creating a new front-end from scratch by using the latest technologies. My role goes from defining the roadmap for the product to implementing it.

From a personal standpoint I enjoy working with the latest technologies in order to design new products that have the power to revolutionise an industry. I am currently working with front-end technologies but have previously have had no issues with taking on subjects such as distributed systems, programming language design or more recently, chatbots.

In the future, in order to have more impact on the projects I am working on, I would like to get closer to product ownership and product design positions. I am thus looking forward to companies which can give me a path to such a career.

I am a tolerant and social person who enjoys bonding with my team and creating a joyful environment around me. I take ownership of my projects and don't hesitate to take on tasks that can help grow the company.
